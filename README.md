pyWavefront3D
=============

Library that generates .obj files

pyWavefront3D geometry system implements a .OBJ file export system.
This is part of a larger project for my capstone project for
`Mechanical Engineering` so heads up, it's no masterpiece of code.

Further, as this library is being developed it hasn't been tested as to work
with other cad programs beyond an meshlab and snappyHexMesh.
Work needs to be done to ensure that it plays nicely with whatever program
the OBJ files are being imported to.

Nothing, it's self contained in it's __init__ file!
